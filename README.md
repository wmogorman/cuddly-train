Learning Git and GitHub with Visual Studio

This repository is my practice space for learning the basics of Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio integration. It’s not tied to any specific project yet—just a sandbox for experimenting and getting comfortable with the workflow.

Goals

Understand how Git tracks changes.

Learn branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

Get used to pushing/pulling with GitHub from Visual Studio.

Build good habits for commits, messages, and organization.

What You’ll Find Here

Simple test files for practice commits.

Notes, experiments, and code snippets as I go.

Nothing “production-ready”—this repo exists for learning.

Notes to Self

Keep commit messages clear and descriptive.

Don’t worry about mistakes—Git history makes it easy to roll back.

As I get more comfortable, I can start real projects here or spin up new repos.
